### Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.
Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include detailed information about the environment, package version numbers, OS and other information maintainers may find useful in reproducing and resolving issues quickly.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report
Check that the bug does not exists because of any issue in your local environment. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. If the problem has been reported **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
